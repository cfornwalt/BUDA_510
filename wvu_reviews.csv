0,"Half the dorms don't have AC, so invest in fans. Parties every night, if you're into that type of thing. Classes are surprisingly rigorous, so make sure you have some time management skills."
1,"I picked West Virginia University because of its smaller size initially. However, going into my senior year WVU has encompassed all the characteristics of a big college. WVU has great professors, diversity, many resources to help its students, and that friendly feel to it. Located in Morgantown, WV there is plenty of things to do in your free time and is still only about an hour from my hometown. To me, itâ€™s the perfect choice!"
2,"As a former student-athlete at WVU, at enjoyed the sports scene and the support that we received from both students and staff. The campus itself is convenient for students without their own transportation and over the years so many renovations have been made. I have seen the growth all around campus; from the academic facilities to the sports facilities all things are at the top of their class. The academic options at the school are varying and allow all programs to be catered to all different types of students. I especially appreciate the growth of the programs and the new subjects that have been added. Specifically, WVU is one of the only schools to have an Undergraduate Forensic Science program and a Graduate Forensic Program. They most recently created a law program with an emphasis in Forensic law, which shows their innovation and willingness to grow the field. I am grateful to my time spent there as a student-athlete."
3,"Students are often defined by there place of education. At West Virginia University, students are defined by their experiences, skills and mindset. I have always enjoyed attending West Virginia University. A change in scenery from the Jersey Shore to rocky mountains, it has become my new home. Or home away from home. I met many professors who dedicated their time to better my education. Then there are professors just here for the pay check. Sometimes hard work doesn't not pay off and I know that's the truth. I am happy for the many opportunities I have been given throughout my college career."
4,Why would WVU accept the invitation to enter the Big 12 Conference & agree not to have a softball program? Doesn't make since. Missing out on athletics & academics. It's the Big 12? No softball? ðŸ‘Ž
5,WVU is in the Big 12 & doesn't have a softball team. Why would any AD agree to such an assinine decision.
6,I had all of my classes online because of covid. Some instructors were so strict with little things like spelling even when the professor themselves messed that up. Some exams had a short period of time for a lot of questions. The worst thing of all is that the professors gave us way more content then what we would have gone over in a normal class because there is no interruptions on the online classes.
7,I really love how the university as a whole has such spirit. I have had some really great professors and then not so much. I would change the fact that some classes are way harder than they should be especially if it is supposed to be an introduction class.
8,The class is good and the people are great. All around the campus is very nice and I enjoy every moment of being there.
9,Very good easier than being in class professors are very good at online teaching. I would now much rather prefer to finish school online easy and I can do my classes when I want with no restrictions.
10,"I like it hear, they had cool things like fall fest and adventures prior to covid. The campus and the resources are amazing."
11,"The experience is as hard as you make it. For the most part they have good resources, but you have to do your research and deep digging to find what you really need."
12,Many of my classes have been switched to online. Most professors learned how to adapt and made things work for the students and were generally understanding when it came to technical issues as such.
13,"I like the education an amount of support resources I found offered in my specific field. I do feel the institution needs to do more/ better when it comes to dealing with social issues. They claim to care and ""Advocate"" for issues like sexual assault, violence, racism, etc., but when an issue is brought to their attention, the most common route they choose to take is sliding things under the rug."
14,"Obviously COVID has changed things everywhere, but without COVID my experience at WVU has been amazing. I've meet lifelong friends through the dorm-life and through club baseball. WVU has great athletics, so going to sporting events is very fun. Overall, a great place to learn and grow as well as have some fun to get your mind off of classes."
15,"Online learning is tough anywhere with COVID protocols, some professors do a better job than others, so it's really a matter of who you have. I've had a couple of professors that have done an excellent job with online classes and others that don't do a good job."
16,"This is a great school, the only problem is the difficulty to learn without lectures or in person/zoom classes."
17,Learning online is very difficult and I feel as if we are not provided enough resources to switch from in person to online learning.
18,"I have loved my experience at WVU. I was able to get involved, maintain a job, and do well in classes. I have grown from my WVU experience and would recommend it to anyone."
19,My learning experience has been great. I enjoy my major and like the instructors in my department. They want you to do well.
